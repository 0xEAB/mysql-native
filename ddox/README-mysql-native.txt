This copy of DDOX is included in the mysql-native repository for
mysql-native's convenience.

This is based on DDOX's 'v0.16.6' tag, with the following changes:

- Added this 'README-mysql-native.txt' file.

- Altered 'dub.sdl' to include the version identifier 'VibeUseOpenSSL11' so
it will succesfully link on my machine (Workaround DDOX Issue #186)
